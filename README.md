  <h2>About Paradox AntiCheat</h2>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a powerful tool designed to combat cheating in Minecraft Bedrock worlds. The name "Paradox" was chosen because the concept of paradox perfectly represents the essence of what we do.</p>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat is a statement that contradicts itself. It is a tool that fights cheating by using advanced algorithms and techniques that are themselves paradoxical in nature.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Paradox: A statement or situation that contradicts itself, opposed to common sense and yet perhaps true.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Paradox AntiCheat offers a comprehensive solution for detecting and preventing cheating in Minecraft Bedrock. It uses detection methods to ensure that cheaters are caught and punished. In addition, Paradox AntiCheat is highly customizable, allowing game developers to tailor the tool to their specific needs and requirements.</p>

<h1>Applying the Paradox AntiCheat Pack</h1>
<p>When applying the pack to your world make sure the addon is at the top of the behavior pack list and Beta APIs is enabled. This is to ensure all checks and systems work properly. The versioning system for Paradox goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first number denotes the pack version. This will rarely change unless there has been major changes to the code.</li>
  <li>The second number denotes the major revision of the pack version. These particular changes mostly involve around features being added or removed.</li>
  <li>The third number indicates the minor revision of the Pack. This evolves around bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Gaining Permission to Use Paradox</h2>
<p>To give yourself permission to use Paradox in your world you will need to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Edit a file inside this project called <code>config.js</code>. It can be located at <code>/scripts/data/config.js</code>.</li>
  <li>In this file, towards the bottom, you will find a property called <code>encryption</code> and this property will contain an additional property called <code>password</code>.</li>
  <li>You MUST fill in your password or you will NOT gain permission to use Paradox during the initial process. There will be an example provided inside the file to show you how to do it.</li>
  <li>Once you have filled in your password then you will need to take note of your password. Do not share it with anyone, unless at your own risk.</li>
  <li>Install the Anti Cheat, load your world, then enter the command <code>!op &lt;password&gt;</code>. This will grant you permission to use Paradox and from here you can give others permission to use paradox with the command <code>!op &lt;username&gt;</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more information about this Anti Cheat and its options then see the command <code>!help</code>.</p>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Paradox will kick you out if you have any illegal items in your inventory so if you think Paradox may flag you after installing then it is highly suggested to drop your entire inventory prior to activating this Anti Cheat!!!</li>
  <li>If you reset your world for any reason then it is recommended to change <code>password</code>.</li>
</ul>
